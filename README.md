This project, as the name suggests, is a way to collect Feedback.
It contains two parts,
a binary to host on a webserver which will serve a simple site to collect the feedback
and a Docker image to write that feedback with a time stamp to a dynamic file on the disk.

Both parts require a .env file, more info in the README of the projects.
